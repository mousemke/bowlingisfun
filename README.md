Babbel Dev Teet
=======================================

Hi! I made you this.

Deploy and testing should be straight forward.

clone the repo and move into the directory

```
git clone git@github.com:mousemke/bowlingisfun.git
cd babbel-js-test
```

Install the dependencies. This will run most of the tests.

```
npm i
```

Start the server, and run the other tests.  The first time the tests run it generates the baseline images for the regression testing.
######* note: the server will need it's own terminal window

```
npm run serve
npm test
```

You're all set!  Go to the site at [http://localhost:8078](http://localhost:8078)

## npm scripts

Everything is controlled through the npm scripts.  There are some that are only used by the other scripts that I will leave off of this list.
